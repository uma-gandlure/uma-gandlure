## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m an Electronics and Communication Engineering student with a strong interest in **Digital VLSI Design** and **ASIC development**. I’m currently focused on building skills in **Verilog HDL**, designing RTL-based systems, and implementing them on FPGA boards like **Artix-7**.

I'm also preparing for **GATE 2026/27** to pursue MTech in **VLSI Design** from a top-tier institute in India.


## 🔧 Skills

- **Languages**: Verilog HDL, C (basic)
- **Tools**: Xilinx Vivado.
- **Hardware**: Edge Artix-7 FPGA board,Aurdino UNO
- **Core Areas**:
  - RTL Design
  - FSM-based Design
  - Digital Logic & Synchronous Systems
  - 7-Segment Display Control
  - Sensor Interfacing (HC-SR04)


## 📂 Projects

- **Ultrasonic Sensor-Based Room Occupancy Counter**  
  A Verilog-based system using two HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors to detect entry/exit and display remaining room capacity on a 2-digit 7-segment display (implemented on Edge Artix-7 FPGA).

- **Finite State Machine Projects (RTL)**  
  Basic FSM designs like traffic light controller, vending machine logic, and sequence detectors.

> More projects are under development as I continue exploring FPGA-based RTL design.

## 🎯 Career Goals

- Strengthen RTL and ASIC design knowledge  
- Complete hands-on FPGA and HDL-based projects  
- Crack GATE and pursue MTech in VLSI  
- Work as an ASIC Design Engineer in a top semiconductor company (e.g., Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD)
